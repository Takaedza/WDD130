        <h2>Poetry</h2>
        <p>poetry, literature that evokes a concentrated imaginative awareness of experience or a specific emotional response through language chosen and arranged for its meaning, sound, and rhythm. Poetry is a vast subject, as old as history and older, present wherever religion is present, possibly—under some definitions—the primal and primary form of languages themselves. The present article means only to describe in as general a way as possible certain properties of poetry and of poetic thought regarded as in some sense independent modes of the mind. Naturally, not every tradition nor every local or individual variation can be—or need be—included, but the article illustrates by examples of poetry ranging between nursery rhyme and epic. This article considers the difficulty or impossibility of defining poetry; man’s nevertheless familiar acquaintance with it; the differences between poetry and prose; the idea of form in poetry; poetry as a mode of thought; and what little may be said in prose of the spirit of poetry.</p>

        <h2>Theater</h2>
        <p>Theatre is a collaborative art form which combines words, voice, movement and visual elements to express meaning. The field of theatre encompasses not only live improvised and
            scripted work, but also dramatic forms such as film, television and other electronic media. Due
            to the increasingly pervasive influence of contemporary theatrical media, theatre has enormous
            importance in citizens’ lives. It is not possible for students to achieve media literacy without
            understanding and having hands-on experience with theatre. Theatre is about the examination
            and resolution of fundamental human issues, and is built on understanding and presenting interactions between people.
