    <h2>Mr Mandie, Rev Stoc's / Taka</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I am Takaedza Godfrey Mandinyenya. I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology BS currently doing my first certificate in Web and Computer programming. I keen interest in poetry writing and business development. The main I enrolled for this program is to help explore ways I can further use my creative mind to grow beyond just writing. I am the youngest out of three siblings. I am currently employed by Start-up Company that is into paint manufacturing company based in Zimbabwe.</p>
    <p>My siblings have always encouraged me to study something to do with programming as there have seen the interest I have in that field. The time I got introduced to Pathway, I found out that I can pursue a degree program in Applied Technology I followed the encourage I had from my siblings. I love the opportunity that I have found with BYU Idoha as it has opened me to many career prospects I never imagined existed.</p>
