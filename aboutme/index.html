            <p class="main-para">Hello everyone! I am Takaedza Godfrey Mandinyenya. I am Pirsuing a degreee in Applied Technology BS currently doing my first certificate in Web and Computer programminng. I have a keen interest in poetry writing and business development. The main reason I enrolled for this program is to hwelp me explore new ways I can further use my creative mind to grow beyond just writing. I am the youngest out of three siblings. I am currenty employed by a start-up Company that is into paint manufacturing based in Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p>My siblings have always encouraged me to study something to do with programming as there have seen the interest I have in that field. The time I got introduced to Pathway, I found out that I could pursue a degree program in Applied Technology I followed their encouragement. I love the opportunity that i have found with BYU Idoha as it has opened me up to many career prospects I never imagined existed.</p>
